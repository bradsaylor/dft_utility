| `$@`     | **Target**                              | The name of the file that is the target of the rule.                                                                 |

| `$^`     | **All prerequisites**                   | All dependencies of the rule, with duplicates removed.                                                               |
| `$+`     | **All prerequisites (with duplicates)** | Like `$^`, but preserves duplicates and order.                                                                       |
